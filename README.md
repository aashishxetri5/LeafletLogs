Simple Blogging Platform

Develop a simple blogging platform with Node.js and Express. Users should be able to create new blog posts, view a list of all posts, and read individual posts. Initially, you can store blog posts in an array or a file, and later you might consider integrating a simple database like SQLite.
Goal: Introduction to web server creation, handling HTTP requests, and basic templating with engines like EJS or Handlebars.
